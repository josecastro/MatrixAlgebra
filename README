Basic matrix algebra implemented in C++ using operators and automatic objects
current implementation is not re-entrant, meaning it will not support
multiple threads using the same library, this is due to the implementation
of automatic objects (ie matrices and vectors) using a circular buffer which
becomes a critical region, mutual exclusion should be implemented to achieve
re-entrance.
